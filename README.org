NOTE: Python-based analyses were originally written and executed in emacs org documents, then
converted to jupyter notebooks for sharing. These conversions have their quirks
so two converted versions for the relevant notebooks exist:
- Files ending in ~orgparse.ipynb~: converted using the =orgparse= library.
  These contain code that can be directly run in an interactive session, though
  much of the original formatting is lost.
- Files ending in ~pandoc.ipynb~: converted using =pandoc=. These are nicer to
  look at, but are ultimately a single =markdown= cell and thus code cannot be
  run like a typical jupyter notebook.
