Cytosim is a cytoskeleton simulation engine 

#documentation
The documentation was generated by ‘doxygen’ and must be open in a browser:
Open `doc/index.html’.

In the documentation, you will find a module describing how to compile Cytosim. On Mac OS X and Linux this should be straightforward if you are familiar with compilation in general. On Windows, we suggest that you compile within Cygwin. More more information, please check src/doc/compile.dox.

Once cytosim is running on your machine, open doc.html, check the tutorial, the page on ‘Running Simulations’, and the examples contained in the folder ‘cym’. We recommend starting with the shortest configuration files (e.g. fiber.cym). Finally, do not hesitate to contact us if you have difficulties: cytosim@cytosim.org

We hope cytosim can be useful for your research. 

Sincerely yours,
     The developers of Cytosim
